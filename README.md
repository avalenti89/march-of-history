# Introduction

This repository contains some usefull script that enhance the functionality of the game <a href="https://www.marchofhistory.com/" target="_blank">March of History</a> (that I suggest you to play if you like historical strategy game).

These scripts are not created to hack the game, but to give a fresh life to a game that is in alpha since 2014.

I invite you to join the game and support it with Premium Shop if you like it, even if it's an old game.

Anyways, if you like my works, you can offer me a beer (beacause I don't drink coffe, even if I am a developer)

# Overview

This monorepo will contains script divided by "engine".

## Userscripts

Inside this folder you can find scripts and library for GreaseMonkey (Google Chrome) and TamperMonkey (Firefox) that are extensions that allow you to run custom JS scripts on a page.

The scripts will be those that ends with '.user.js' and are that you have to install in browser extension.

You can also found my script ready to install clicking <a href="https://openuserjs.org/users/avalenti89/scripts" target="_blank">here</a>

## Userscript-react

This project is a WIP and it will contains a UI component that allows you to use all my script manually(and keep track of them) with some new UI stuff for the game.

I don't know when I will start to work on this.
